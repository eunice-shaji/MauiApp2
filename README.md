# MauiApp2

This project is a sample .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) application developed as part of a APPLIED ACtivity
It demonstrates the basic structure, components, and execution process of a cross-platform mobile and desktop application built using *C#* and *.NET MAUI*.


##  Project Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Setting up and running a .NET MAUI project in Visual Studio  
- Understanding the structure of MAUI applications (App.xaml, MainPage, MauiProgram)  
- Working with namespaces, initialization, and basic UI pages  
- Debugging and resolving build or namespace errors in MAUI projects  

This project helps in building a foundation for developing real-world mobile or desktop applications using Microsoft’s cross-platform framework.



##  Overview
The *MauiApp2* project includes:
- A main application class (App.xaml and App.xaml.cs)
- A startup configuration file (MauiProgram.cs)
- A main user interface page (MainPage.razor or MaainPage.razor)
- A README.md file explaining the purpose, structure, and setup


##  Features
- Cross-platform support for *Android, **iOS, **Windows, and **Mac*
- Built using *C#* and *XAML*
- Demonstrates how to link and launch the main application page
- Example of simple UI page integration


##  Requirements
To successfully run this project, ensure the following software and tools are installed:
- *Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.6 or later)*  
- *.NET 8.0 SDK* (or compatible MAUI workload)  
- Windows or macOS system with proper device emulators or simulators installed  



##  How to Run the Application
1. Open *Visual Studio* and load the MauiApp2.sln solution file.  
2. Check that all files (App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, MainPage.razor, and MauiProgram.cs) use the same namespace (e.g., namespace MauiApp2;).  
3. In the toolbar, select a target platform (e.g., *Windows Machine* or *Android Emulator*).  
4. Press *F5* or click *▶ Start Debugging*.  
5. The app will compile and display the main page.

##  Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, the following concepts were learned:
- The difference between App.xaml, App.xaml.cs, and MauiProgram.cs
- How to manage namespaces and project files in .NET MAUI  
- Debugging typical build errors like missing types, namespaces, or mismatched class names  
- Creating a README.md file for documentation purposes  



##  Future Improvements
- Add multiple pages with navigation support  
- Include interactive UI controls and data binding  
- Integrate SQLite or API data  
- Customize styling and layout using XAML themes
